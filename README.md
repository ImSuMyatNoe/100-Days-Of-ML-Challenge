# 100-Days-Of-ML-Challenge
## Siraj Raval has challenged the machine learning/deep learning community to commit to 100 days of machine learning. Challenge accepted!
### Day 1 -> Data Preprocessing

> Use Imputer from sklearn method to handle the missing data.
strategy : string, optional (default=”mean”)
The imputation strategy.

If “mean”, then replace missing values using the mean along the axis.
If “median”, then replace missing values using the median along the axis.
If “most_frequent”, then replace missing using the most frequent value along the axis.
axis : integer, optional (default=0)

The axis along which to impute.

If axis=0, then impute along columns.
If axis=1, then impute along rows.

> sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder
encode categorical integer features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme.

> sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True
> Simple Liner Regression Model is used for One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
In Data Visualization we use matplotlib , We spilt the XTrain and XTest.We only use X variable because X is independent variable.
