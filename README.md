# 100-Days-Of-ML-Challenge
## Siraj Raval has challenged the machine learning/deep learning community to commit to 100 days of machine learning. Challenge accepted!
## Remark Here!
I re-uploaded my files (Day 1 & Day2 ) in Day 3. Beacause of rename some files. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1 -> Data Preprocessing
> Use Imputer from sklearn method to handle the missing data.
strategy : string, optional (default=”mean”)
The imputation strategy.

If “mean”, then replace missing values using the mean along the axis.
If “median”, then replace missing values using the median along the axis.
If “most_frequent”, then replace missing using the most frequent value along the axis.
axis : integer, optional (default=0)

The axis along which to impute.

If axis=0, then impute along columns.
If axis=1, then impute along rows.

> sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder
encode categorical integer features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme.

> sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True
> Simple Liner Regression Model is used for One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
In Data Visualization we use matplotlib , We spilt the XTrain and XTest.We only use X variable because X is independent variable.

### Day 2 -> Logistic Regression
> Although I added the note yesterday but some how I forgot to Click Commit Changes. But you can see my code how multipe logistic regression worked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 3 -> Apriori Algorithm
https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/machine-learning/beginners-tutorial-apriori-algorithm-data-mining-r-implementation/
> Aprior Algorithm is one of the Data Mining Algorithms used in recommendations such as amzon web service. I read the detail of the Alg from the link that I mentioned earlier.
> The error I found here is I used with anaconda cloud and jupyter notebook, I can't import packages to anacond because of unstastified resources.
> The next thing is I have learned in Day 3 is Clustering. In clustering , there is K - Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
The most well known is K - Means ALG. In the below, I've attached a link that explain well and thoroughly abut K - Means.
K-means is  one of  the simplest unsupervised  learning  algorithms.
